  "long_description": "Torrent Manager is a comprehensive Python application that provides unified control over multiple torrent clients (rTorrent and Transmission) through both a REST API and command-line interface. It features a web-based frontend for browser-based management, secure session-based and API key authentication, torrent activity logging and tracking, automated maintenance tasks (moving completed torrents, pausing long-seeded torrents), and database management for users, torrents, and activity. The application supports both local and remote torrent server connections with HTTP-based file serving and optional local mount support.",
